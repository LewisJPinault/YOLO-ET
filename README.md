YOLO-ET Jupyter Notebook Project

Welcome to our YOLO-ET Jupyter Notebook project! This README file accompanies our article 'YOLO-ET: a Machine Learning Model for Detecting, Localising and Classifying Anthropogenic Contaminants and Extraterrestrial Microparticles Optimised for Mobile Processing Systems' by Pinault et al. 2024.

This repository contains:

-- The YOLO-ET Jupyter Notebook, YOLO_ET.ipynb
-- The YOLO-ET trained model for running in the Jupyter Notebook, using the Turi Create Library, in a folder titled YOLO-ET
-- A sample test image to try, in the folder test_images
-- Labels to match the test image, in a file named labels_test.json

Getting Started
To get started with the YOLO-ET notebook, you'll need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. If you don't have Jupyter yet, you can install it by following the instructions on the Jupyter Project website, https://jupyter.org/install

We recommend using a virtual environment to use, install, or build Turi Create. Note that currently Turi Create requires Python < 3.8

To install Turi Create in the new virtual environment, do the following:

pip install -U turicreate
